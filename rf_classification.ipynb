You want to see really high percentages for a given class and the prediction of the given class. If the training data are ambiguous for a class you will probably see that there are high percentages for each given class that are predicted incorrectly.

There is a possibility that the lab computers don't allow us to store data on the C drive. If that is the case, we may need to change it to a temp folder in our OneDrive. There is also a small chance it might crash your computer... Or just take way too long. If that is the case, I will run the classification for you on my office computer (after the lab) and send you the results (hopefully we can avoid this, though). If you need to do this, please keep all the necessary files in the same folder, compress the folder (right-click, compress as zip) and then email it to me.
